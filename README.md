Duostack Socket.IO Demo
=======================

[http://github.com/tfe/duostack-socket.io-demo](http://github.com/tfe/duostack-socket.io-demo)

This is a super-simple demo app of basic [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) usage on the [Duostack](http://duostack.com/) Node.js hosting platform.

It simply displays the time on the server, updated live every second. If you see the time appear and continuously update, then it's working properly.

The code is very short and self-explanatory, but essentially:

1. We create a server to serve the initial page and to which we can attach Socket.IO.
2. On every request we just send down the contents of `demo.html`, which is a little HTML document containing a little markup and the Socket.IO client-side script and configuration.
3. We also attach a Socket.IO listener to the server and set it up to send down the current time on new connections, and every one second thereafter.
